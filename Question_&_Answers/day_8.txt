1. What is MSE?
ANS: MSE (mean square error) simply refers to the mean of the squared difference between the predicted parameter and the observed parameter.

2. What is gradient descent?
ANS: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that's used when training a machine learning model. It's based on a convex function and tweaks its parameters iteratively to minimize a given function to its local minimum.

3. What is joblib?
ANS: Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python. In particular:
1)transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation (memoize pattern)
2)easy simple parallel computing
Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust on large data in particular and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays

5. What is pickle?
ANS: Pickle is a python module used to serialize a python object into a binary format and deserialize it back to the python object.
