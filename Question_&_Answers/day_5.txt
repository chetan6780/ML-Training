1. Define Python Pandas
-->Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

2. What Are The Different Types Of Data Structures In Pandas?
--> Different Types Of Data Structures In Pandas are:
- Series(1d homogeneous array)
- DataFrame(2d labeled heterogeneous array) 
- Panel(general 3d array)

3. Define Dataframe In Pandas
-->A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure. Data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.

4. How Can You Create An Empty Dataframe In Pandas?
-->We can create an empty dataframe with the help using DataFrame() like this df = pd.DataFrame()

5. What Are The Most Important Features Of The Pandas Library?
-->
- DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
- Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.
- Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
- Reshaping and pivoting of data sets.
- Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets.
- Data structure column insertion and deletion.
- Group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets.
- Data set merging and joining.
- Hierarchical axis indexing to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.
- Time series-functionality: Date range generation[4] and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging.
- Provides data filtration.

6. What Is Groupby Function In Pandas?
-->Groupby function split the data in groups based on given criteria.
