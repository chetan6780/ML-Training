1. What is Numpy?
-->NumPy is a library in Python , adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on the arrays.

2. Why NumPy is used in Python?
-->NumPy used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

3. Where is NumPy used?
-->It can be utilised to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines.

4. Difference between numpy and Python List.
-->1.List consumes more space than numpy array while numpy array are space efficient.
2.Numpy arrays are faster as compared to List.

5. How to convert 1D Numpy array to 2D Numpy array.
-->To convert 1D Numpy array to 2D Numpy array we use reshape() method of Numpy.

6. How to find the memory size of any array?
-->numpy.reshape(array, new_shape, order) 

7. What is use of Pandas?
-->Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.

8. What is Series in Pandas?
-->Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.
